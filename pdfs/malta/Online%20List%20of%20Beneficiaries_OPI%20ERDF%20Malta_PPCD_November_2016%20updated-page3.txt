Rehabilitation of Xewkija Windmill
Internationalization Knowledge Platform
The Redevelopment of Ta' Qali Crafts Village
The Extension of Xewkija Industrial Park
Removal of bottleneck on TEN-T (Node EA15- Kappara)

The proposed project will consist of the restoration of Xewkija Windmill and the stabilization in order to provide an innovative cultural and historical tourism experience aiming to improve Gozo's tourism product.
Trade Malta proposes to assist SMEs be better prepared to internationalize by investing in a knowledge infrastructure. This internationalisation knowledge hub will include both a content-rich digital platform which SMEs will be able to use, and input for a series of training and advisory interventions aimed at capacity building amongst SMEs based in Malta and interested in internationalisation
The Ta’ Qali Crafts Village, spread over a footprint of 63,000 sq. m, is an area owned and administered by Malta Industrial Parks Ltd. and is made up of a number of traditional Maltese crafts operators. The proposed project aims to redevelop the village and to create a centre of excellence for traditional Maltese artisans operating in the manufacturing of traditional Maltese goods and crafts. Malta Industrial Parks Ltd. will be investing to upgrade and embellish the infrastructure of the common areas to improve the environment for the operators and visitors. It aims at increasing the attractiveness of the location as a traditional Maltese crafts village to enable operators to showcase their artisanship and increase visitor numbers to ensure long term sustainability of the crafts village.
The objective of the project is to extend the Xewkija industrial park which is an area owned and administered by Malta Industrial Parks Ltd. in Gozo. The intention is to develop the vacant space known as tal-Hofra into 15 new business workshops having a total of 5,355 sq. m for industrial activity. Moreover, at the MDP site, Malta Industrial Parks Ltd. intends to demolish the existing buildings and construct an indoor multipurpose facility comprising a 1,950 sq.m high-bay industrial space at level -1 together with a total of 4,060 sq. m of lettable business space at levels 1 and 2 to accommodate Research & Development, innovation, back office, filming and gaming operations, financial services and software development among other type of operations. The underlying intentions are the transfer of business activities away from the village core, enabling further economic growth through better diversification in the economy, and to provide further job opportunities for people living in Gozo.
This project consists of the upgrading of the existing roundabout junction at Node EA15 to a grade separated junction with the aim to eliminate the current bottleneck which is the cause of daily traffic queues and extended journey times for road users. Malta’s Action Plan towards the Transport Ex-ante Conditionality and the draft Transport Master Plan (2015-2025), identifies this Project as a priority project. Implementation is programmed between 2016 and 2018. Being the busiest section of the Comprehensive TEN-T network in Malta, with a daily traffic volume in excess of 90,000 vehicles, the current at-grade layout of roads and junctions cannot accommodate the high volumes of traffic. The removal of this major traffic bottleneck will improve connectivity, accessibility, safety, sustainability and reduce significant negative environmental, social and economic impacts resulting from transport externalities.
