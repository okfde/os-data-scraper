PBS has over 24,200 hours of footage dating back to 1960 which is in dire state of deterioration both as result of lapse of time and use. These tapes and reels are a visual record of the history of Malta and provide a good insight of Malta’s intangible cultural heritage. Through this project, PBS will embark on the digitization process to ensure that this footage is preserved for future generations as well as made available for tourist consumption. Clip development of heritage sites and attractions from the digitized archives will be accessible on the identified sites with the aim to enhance the tourist experience.
The Establishment of a Regional Museum for Gozo.
The transformation of the Notarial Archives building at the 17th century palazzo at No. 24 St Christopher Street, Valletta and the adjacent building at No. 217 St Paul’s Street, into one leading centre for historical and scientific investigation that will house the Archives' ever-expanding collection of over 20,000 notarial volumes of international prestige and rich historical and social value. The centre will be made into a state-of-the-art paper conservation hub which is fully accessible to the local and international research community as well as cultural tourists.
The aim of this project is to continue in the preservation and upgrading of the oldest working national theatre in the World and a Grade 1, listed, and scheduled building; the Manoel Theatre. This project will provide an improved, high-quality experience tothe patrons of the Manoel Theatre through the implementation and installation of a new ventilation and acclimatization system, which replaces the ventilation system installed in 1811, and which is not adequate to create a comfortable ambiance in terms of air temperature control, humidity levels and air purification. In addition to the climate control system, the roof, seating and floor of the same theatre will be revamped. By means of this investment the theatre shall benefit from improved acoustics which are critical for Malta's only opera venue.
The project will consist of the development and installation of a state-of-the-art system whereby with the use smart phones or tablets, visitors will experience fifteen different scenes from the era of the Knights of St John, and epic battles from the 1st and 2nd World Wars that changed the course of Malta's history; in real time. This will be made possible following the downloading of a mobile application, developed specifically for this purpose, and compatible with both IOS and Android systems. This experience shall take place within the grand halls of the Mediterranean Conference Centre which shall be restored and made accessible through the project.
The Chadwick Lakes project aims to conserve and promote the Wied il-Qlejjgha (Chadwick Lakes) for tourism purposes. It will invest in the natural and cultural resources of the site. The primary objective will be that of regenerating and valorizing the valley, creating an innovative venue for natural heritage tourism, whilst generating sensitivity toward biodiversity. In principle, therefore it is fully aligned with the scope of Priority Axis 5 of Operational Programme I. Natural heritage tourism remains untapped in Malta and hence this will be an innovative experience seeking to exploit a niche market. The project will transform this location, from its present derelict state, into a natural park, restoring valley biodiversity and the original valley profile to enhance water storage. Being close to Mdina and Rabat, the site has high potential to integrate with the surrounding heritage sites and nonetheless with the forthcoming Water Conservation Awareness Centre at Rabat.
