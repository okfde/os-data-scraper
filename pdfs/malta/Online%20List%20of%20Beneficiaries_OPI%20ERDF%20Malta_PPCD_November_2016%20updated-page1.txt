Promotion of RES in the Domestic Sector (2016-2018)
Grandmasters' Palace Regeneration Project
The MICAS Galleries
MUZA - The National- Community Art Museum
The Malta Carnival Experience

The RES support scheme provides financial support to cover part of the costs of PV systems installed in domestic use. The scheme will be open to all energy consumers in the domestic sector and available funds will be allocated on a first come first served basis.
The Project seeks to restore, rehabilitate and enhance the valorisation of the Grandmasters’ Palace as one of the foremost monuments in the World Heritage Site of Valletta. This shall be achieved through specific interventions which primarily revolve around the relocation and rehabilitation of the Knights’ Armoury as an outstanding visitor attraction, the restoration and sustainable rehabilitation of spaces presently not accessible to visitors into new themed environments and the overall improvement of the site’s infrastructure to be able to reach modern visitors' needs and expectations. Specific attention shall also be given to improve substantially the overall accessibility of the site to the physically impaired within the constraints imposed by the building's historic fabric.
The Maltese Government has committed to restore and rehabilitate the San Salvatore bastion area, its entrenchments, historical ramparts and glacis in Floriana so as to provide another large democratised outdoor space for the public to enjoy. This recent development gives rise to the possibility of situating within this striking location the much awaited Malta International Contemporary Art Space – MICAS, which is another milestone in the government's programme for culture and a projected legacy proposal for Valletta 2018 European Capital of Culture. The project proposal seeks to valorise the larger part of the San Salvatore Bastion area by developing within this natural, cultural and historical landscape, currently inaccessible and underutilised, the MICAS Galleries.
MUZA is Malta’s new museum of art and flagship project for Valletta’s 2018 European Capital of Culture. The project is a National-Community Museum, the first of its kind, being developed in a historic site within the Capital City of Valletta, a UNESCO World Heritage Site built as a city-fortress. It shall be green-powered, generating its energy requirements through renewable sources, and represent a best practice in retro-fitting a Maltese historic building.
The Ministry for Justice, Culture and Local Government is hereby submitting a project for the implementation of the Malta Carnival Experience, which will seek to nurture, promote, develop and showcase the different art forms of the Maltese Carnival, which dates back to the early 16th Century. This will aim to present an all-year round intangible cultural experience to visitors, which will include a Carnival Museum, Audiovisual Centre, Interactive Workshops, Dance Rehearsal Studio, a Parade Ground, Reception and Orientation Centre, Coffee Shop and Souvenir Shop. The Maltese Carnival Experience will feature the various carnival themed art-forms such as float-making, maskeruni, music, dance, costume-making and other carnival themed activities that are linked to the Maltese carnival.
